# Computer Science Non Exam Assessment
This is my computer science NEA project for which I am making a site that will visualise 
sorting algorithms. I am using react.js to build an interactive website for the front end, and 
I am using python to write a REST api and the sorting algorithms that will be used and 
demonstrated.

If cloned you will need to run:
### `npm run start`
 - which will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser where you can
see the current state of the site

### `npm run api`
 - which will put the python api up on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) so the algorithms can be accessed and used

or you can run

### `npm run up`
 - which will run them both

*npm run up is currently unavailable*
